# vkOceanWaves
A Vulkan-based ocean wave simulator.

This is my first project built with the Vulkan API and uses my code from following the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) (through the Uniform Buffers chapter) as a starting point.

I plan to implement the techniques described in [Chapter 1. Effective Water Simulation from Physical Models](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-i-natural-effects/chapter-1-effective-water-simulation-physical-models) from the book [GPU Gems](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/gpu-gems-home/). Some stretch goals at the time of starting this project are to implement [subsurface scattering](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-iii-materials/chapter-16-real-time-approximations-subsurface-scattering) as well as [radiance cascades](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6v1_7HY2X-LV3Ofb6oyTIxgEaP4LOI6/view) for global illumination.
