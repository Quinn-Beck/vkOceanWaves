# vkOceanWaves
A Vulkan-based ocean wave simulator.

This is my first project built with the Vulkan API and uses my code from following the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) (through the Uniform Buffers chapter) as a starting point.

I plan to implement the techniques described in [Chapter 1. Effective Water Simulation from Physical Models](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-i-natural-effects/chapter-1-effective-water-simulation-physical-models) from the book [GPU Gems](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/gpu-gems-home/). I'm also reading Jerry Tessendorf's notes on [Simulating Ocean Water](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~jtessen/reports/papers_files/coursenotes2004.pdf).
